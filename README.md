# Django Snippet: Verify Email View

This Django snippet demonstrates a simple view for verifying email addresses. It checks if the provided email address is available for user registration and returns an appropriate message.

## Description

The `VerifyEmailView` class is an API view that handles POST requests for email verification. It checks if the email provided in the request data is available for user registration. If the email is available, it returns a message indicating that the email can be used to register a new user. If the email is already associated with a registered user who has been verified, it returns a message indicating that the user already exists. Otherwise, it returns a message indicating that the email is available but not yet associated with a verified user.
